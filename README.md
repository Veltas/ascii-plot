A "quick C warmup", plots 2D coordinates on a scatter graph in the terminal supposedly

Don't even ask about this one, I was bored and made it during a programming assignment. It was like my C warmup, with the aim being to cause myself as much unnecessary hassle as possible.

Maybe I'll add some cool features, in the meantime it is technically useful so this repo is here mainly so I can just add it to whatever computer I'm using at the time.
